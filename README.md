# Community Spam Bot Protector
A bot that prevents scammers from spamming community servers, written in Go.

Created after I got annoyed with scammers joining the [Unitystation](https://www.unitystation.org/) discord server.

This bot only bans new users who just joined the server within an hour, while older users will only get muted.

## How to setup:

1. Go into config.ini and add a token to the bot that you want to host using this.
2. Setup things like the spam limit from the config.ini file.
3. Build the project using `go build` (You must have Go installed)
4. Run the built Application, then let it do its job.
